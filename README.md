Repository for the the Water Resources Research Manuscript titled "Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations Using Ensemble Streamflow Predictions for a Multi-Purpose Reservoir in Northern California".
The contents of this repository include code and input data sets developed in Matlab for the model developed for the study.
Versions of this code are permanently archived here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/706760140.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10019300)  

The following is a short description of the contents of this repository.
RunModels.m - script which assembles and runs the model alternatives (Existing Operations, Ensemble Forecast Operations and Perfect Forecast Operations) evaluated in the study.
+src - folder that includes the source code for the classes that make up the model alternatives.
Inp - folder that includes the model input data sets for the model alternatives.
Results - folder that includes the simulation results in comma separated format (csv) for the model alternatives.
